Rust's package manager is called **Cargo**. It is an integral part of the Rust ecosystem, responsible for managing Rust projects, dependencies, building, and more. Cargo simplifies project setup, dependency management, building, testing, and running Rust code.

### Key Features of Cargo:
1. **Project Initialization**: Easily create new projects with the `cargo new` or `cargo init` commands.
2. **Dependency Management**: Specify and manage external libraries (crates) in the `Cargo.toml` file.
3. **Build and Run**: Build projects and executables with `cargo build` and `cargo run`.
4. **Testing**: Run tests using `cargo test`.
5. **Documentation**: Generate documentation with `cargo doc`.
6. **Crates.io Integration**: Cargo is integrated with **[crates.io](https://crates.io)**, the Rust package registry, where you can publish and discover packages.

### Basic Cargo Commands:

- **Create a New Project:**
   ```bash
   cargo new project_name
   ```

- **Build a Project:**
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

- **Run a Project:**
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

- **Test a Project:**
   ```bash
   cargo test
   ```

- **Add a Dependency:**
   In the `Cargo.toml` file, under the `[dependencies]` section:
   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   regex = "1.5"
   ```

- **Build and Run in Release Mode:**
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

- **Generate Documentation:**
   ```bash
   cargo doc --open
   ```

### `Cargo.toml`:
The `Cargo.toml` file is where you define metadata, dependencies, and package configuration. Here's a simple example of a `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[package]
name = "my_project"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
serde = "1.0"
```

Cargo is an essential tool for Rust developers and plays a major role in making Rust development smooth and efficient.
