To use Rust with an STM32F767 microcontroller, you'll need a linker script to configure the memory layout and startup process properly. STM32 microcontrollers use a standard memory structure with Flash and RAM regions, so your linker script will define these sections and configure where your program is loaded and run from.

Here's a basic template for a linker script (`memory.x`) for the STM32F767:

```ld
/* Specify the memory areas */
MEMORY
{
    FLASH (rx)      : ORIGIN = 0x08000000, LENGTH = 2048K  /* Flash size */
    RAM (xrw)       : ORIGIN = 0x20000000, LENGTH = 512K   /* RAM size */
    CCRAM (xrw)     : ORIGIN = 0x10000000, LENGTH = 128K   /* CCM RAM */
}

/* Define the entry point */
ENTRY(_start)

/* The following sections define the memory regions for the program code and data */
SECTIONS
{
    /* Program code and read-only data goes into Flash */
    .text : 
    {
        KEEP(*(.isr_vector)) /* Interrupt vectors */
        *(.text*)            /* Application code */
        *(.rodata*)          /* Read-only data */
        KEEP(*(.init*))      /* Initialization code */
        KEEP(*(.fini*))      /* Finalization code */
    } > FLASH

    /* Data segment, initialized data goes into RAM */
    .data : AT(ADDR(.text) + SIZEOF(.text))
    {
        *(.data*)            /* Initialized data */
    } > RAM

    /* BSS section for uninitialized data */
    .bss :
    {
        *(.bss*)
    } > RAM

    /* Stack space */
    _stack_start = ORIGIN(RAM) + LENGTH(RAM);
    _stack_end = _stack_start - 0x1000; /* 4KB stack */

    PROVIDE(_heap_start = _stack_end);
    PROVIDE(_heap_end = ORIGIN(RAM));
}
```

### Key Points:
1. **Memory Regions**: 
   - Flash memory starts at `0x08000000` (STM32F7 default Flash address) with 2MB length.
   - RAM starts at `0x20000000` with 512KB of space.
   - Core Coupled RAM (CCRAM) starts at `0x10000000` with 128KB for faster memory access.
   
2. **Sections**: 
   - The `.text` section holds the program code and read-only data.
   - `.data` section holds initialized variables.
   - `.bss` is used for uninitialized variables.
   
3. **Entry Point**: The entry point (`ENTRY(_start)`) is defined to indicate the start of the program.

### Rust and Cargo Setup:
You need to include this script in your `cargo` project. You can use `memory.x` for defining memory and place it in the root of your project. Then, in your `Cargo.toml` file, specify where to find this script:

```toml
[package.metadata.cortex-m-rt]
memory.x = true
```

This will instruct `cargo` to include your custom memory configuration during the build process.

Make sure you have the `cortex-m` and `cortex-m-rt` crates in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
cortex-m = "0.7.3"
cortex-m-rt = "0.7.1"
```

### Toolchain:
You will also need to install the ARM toolchain for cross-compiling Rust to an STM32F767 target:

```bash
rustup target add thumbv7em-none-eabihf
```

This sets up the target architecture for the STM32F7 series.
