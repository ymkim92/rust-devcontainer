Working with the STM32F7 series (like the Nucleo-F767ZI) using Rust involves setting up a Rust development environment and using embedded tools to interact with the STM32 microcontroller. Here's a guide to help you get started with Rust on STM32F7:

### 1. **Install Rust and Embedded Toolchain**
First, ensure you have Rust installed on your system. If you don't, install it using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/):

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Once Rust is installed, add the `thumbv7em-none-eabihf` target, which is for ARM Cortex-M7 (STM32F7 family):

```bash
rustup target add thumbv7em-none-eabihf
```

You'll also need the following dependencies:
- **`cargo-binutils`**: To work with binary utilities for building embedded Rust projects.
- **`llvm-tools-preview`**: For compiling to ARM architecture.
  
```bash
rustup component add llvm-tools-preview
cargo install cargo-binutils
```

### 2. **Setting Up OpenOCD or STLink for Debugging**
You can use OpenOCD or STLink to flash your code and debug on STM32 boards. Install OpenOCD:

```bash
sudo apt install openocd
```

For STLink, you can use the STM32CubeProgrammer from STMicroelectronics, or install it using your package manager if available.

### 3. **Create a New Rust Project**
Create a new project using `cargo`:

```bash
cargo new stm32f7-demo --bin
cd stm32f7-demo
```

Edit the `Cargo.toml` to add the necessary dependencies for working with STM32:

```toml
[dependencies]
cortex-m = "0.7"
cortex-m-rt = "0.7"
cortex-m-rtic = "0.6"  # Real-time interrupt-driven concurrency, optional
embedded-hal = "0.2"   # HAL for embedded devices
stm32f7xx-hal = "0.6"  # HAL specific to STM32F7
panic-halt = "0.2"     # Halts on panic (optional)

[build-dependencies]
cortex-m-rtic = "0.6"  # Optional if you are using RTIC
```

### 4. **Linker Script and Startup Code**
You need a linker script to tell the compiler how to place your code in memory. In your project directory, create a file `memory.x` that matches the memory layout of the STM32F7:

```text
MEMORY
{
  FLASH : ORIGIN = 0x08000000, LENGTH = 1024K
  RAM   : ORIGIN = 0x20000000, LENGTH = 320K
}

SECTIONS
{
  .text : { *(.text*) } > FLASH
  .bss : { *(.bss*) } > RAM
  .data : { *(.data*) } > RAM
}
```

Next, add the following line to `Cargo.toml` to point to this linker script:

```toml
[package.metadata.cortex-m-rt]
memory.x = true
```

### 5. **Programming the STM32F7 Using HAL**
The `stm32f7xx-hal` crate provides high-level access to the STM32F7 peripherals. Here's a simple example that toggles an LED on the Nucleo board:

Edit `src/main.rs`:

```rust
#![no_std]
#![no_main]

use cortex_m_rt::entry;
use panic_halt as _; // You can use other panic handlers like panic_semihosting
use stm32f7xx_hal as hal;
use hal::{prelude::*, stm32, delay::Delay};

#[entry]
fn main() -> ! {
    let cp = cortex_m::Peripherals::take().unwrap();
    let dp = stm32::Peripherals::take().unwrap();

    // Set up the LED on the Nucleo-F767ZI
    let gpiob = dp.GPIOB.split();
    let mut led = gpiob.pb7.into_push_pull_output();

    // Set up system clock
    let rcc = dp.RCC.constrain();
    let clocks = rcc.cfgr.sysclk(216.mhz()).freeze();

    // Set up delay for toggling
    let mut delay = Delay::new(cp.SYST, clocks);

    loop {
        led.set_high().unwrap();
        delay.delay_ms(500_u32);
        led.set_low().unwrap();
        delay.delay_ms(500_u32);
    }
}
```

### 6. **Building and Flashing the Code**

To compile the code for your STM32F7 target, use:

```bash
cargo build --release --target thumbv7em-none-eabihf
```

To flash the code using OpenOCD, use:

```bash
openocd -f board/st_nucleo_f7.cfg
```

In a separate terminal, use `gdb` to flash the `.elf` file:

```bash
gdb-multiarch target/thumbv7em-none-eabihf/release/stm32f7-demo
(gdb) target remote :3333
(gdb) load
(gdb) monitor reset init
(gdb) continue
```

### 7. **Debugging**
To debug, use `cargo-embed` or `probe-rs`:

1. Install `probe-rs`:

    ```bash
    cargo install probe-rs
    ```

2. Start the debug session with:

    ```bash
    cargo embed
    ```

This will flash the firmware and start a debug session.

### 8. **Further Development**
- Explore **Real-Time Interrupt-driven Concurrency (RTIC)** if you want to develop real-time applications using interrupts. RTIC makes it easier to manage tasks and interrupts.
- Use the **embedded-hal** crate to work with hardware peripherals like I2C, SPI, UART, ADC, etc.
  
### Conclusion
Rust provides powerful tools for embedded development, and using it with STM32F7 microcontrollers allows you to write safe and performant code. You'll get type safety, concurrency management, and modern tooling while still being able to interact with low-level hardware.
